## Introduction  
This project used a 1D CNN model to compare two different kinds of noise generated [light curves](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/280/light-curve-of-a-planet-transiting-its-star/).  
The methods of generated light curves are following:  
1. original noise data generated from dataset light curves in [Kepler](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/bulk_data_download/) mission  
2. noise data generated from quasi-period system by [Pearson et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04319)
  
After  constructing several training datasets by using those two methods with theoretic light curve formula in [Mandel & Agol (2002)](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210099), we trained our CNN model with K-fold Cross-Validation. Then we selected the best method to search possible transit light curves for Kepler  dataset.

## Environment  
This project is created with:  
* Python version: 3.8  
* Tensorflow-gpu version: 2.5.0  
* Numpy version: 1.20.3  
* Matplotlib version: 3.4.2  
* astropy version: 4.3.1  

To install quickly:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
Notice:  
If you want to use my code, please ensure package version especially tensorflow version. Sometimes when you used different version, it could be incompatible or some module have be deleted.

## File Guide  
`Kplr/compare_KM.py` - to record and compare magnitude of datas we had chosen from Kepler mission.  
`Kplr/dev_analysis.py` - This file is to analyze sigma of our kepler datas.We divided them into 4 group and hoped to have at least 50 in each group.  
`Kplr/look_star.py` - pre-processing datas from selected kepler mission.  
`Kplr/read_fits.py` - To convert .fits to .txt  
`generate_data_k.py` - To generate training dataset using selected Kepler datas.  
`generate_data_p.py` - To generate training dataset using quasi-period system.  
`model_structure.py` - Our 1D CNN model and training method(K-fold, early stop training)  
`train.py` - To train our model for each sample size of dataset and record training time.  
`mangol.py` - the model to simulate transit event.  
`tool.py` - some common tools we often used.
